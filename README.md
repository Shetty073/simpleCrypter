# simpleCrypter
A simple text cipher program, written in Python, which uses [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

#### Required:
* Python 3 :)
* easyGUI module for python

###### At the time when I added GUI I was not familiar with Tkinter. But now I am, hence I will be updating this code to use Tkinter.

## I love Python.. :)
